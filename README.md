# discord-embed-command

This command allows people with a Certain Permission (In this code, it uses MANAGE_MESSAGES) to make embeds!

all you do is (prefix)embed hi there, this is a test 

for example: .embed welcome everyone to my server!

Obviously you will require discord.js dependency, in which speaking of discord.js, i have not only added this command in discord.js v12, but also in v13! Which will suit majority of people. 

in the footer, it has my name in there for credit purposes, please keep it as i made this command myself. Thanks.
